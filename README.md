# sensors_on_a_map

Idea is to make a simple, interactive ERDDAP time series viewer in a notebook.

- do a query to find the lon,lat points of all time series stations
- put station markers on a map 
- click a station and get a time series plot from the last two weeks of data from a default variable
- select a different variable from a drop down menu
- select a different time period
